# VirConI
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Detector 

## Intel Technologies
DevCloud, Intel NUC, Intel CPU, OpenVINO, DPC++

## Overview / Usage
In construction works, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as helmets (helmets), seat belts, goggles, etc. play a very important role in ensuring the safety of workers. However, many accidents still occur, due to the negligence of workers as well as their supervisors. Supervisors can make mistakes due to the fact that these tasks are monotonous and they may not be able to monitor consistently. This project aims to utilize existing CCTV camera infrastructure to help supervisors monitor workers effectively, providing real-time alerts.

## Methodology / Approach
As an Intel computer vision evangelist and an openSUSE Linux ambassador, I aim to produce intel product materials and installers for this platform. As I've always been doing since 2018 on the innovators program.

## Technologies Used
- OpenCV
- OpenVINO
- CUDA
- openSUSE Linux
- Yolo
